## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- TailwindCSS v3.1.8
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

My biggest takeaway in this was the `group-hover:` functionality in Tailwind. Even though it's quite simple now, getting used to it and implementing it originally was quite challenging for me but I'm happy I managed to make it work.
